    <h1 style ="background-color:yellowgreen ;color: White">RAMADAN UL MUBARAK </h1>
    <p><span style="color:blueviolet;font:bold italic ;">Ramadan</span>, is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, and lasts either 29 or 30 days, depending on when the new crescent moon is, or should be, visible.</p>
    <p><span style="color:blueviolet;font:bold italic ;">Ramadan </span> is the holy month of obligatory fasting (sawm) for Muslims. The Quran tells us its significance. It was the month of Ramadan in which the Quran was first sent down as guidance for all people, having in it clear proofs of divine guidance and the criterion for right and wrong.</p>
    <h2 style="background-color: yellowgreen;color: white">Meals Of Ramadan</h2>
    <p>During Ramadan, two main meals are served.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sehri</li>
        

        <li>Iftar</li>
        
    </ol>
        <h2 style ="background-color:yellowgreen ;color: White">Benefits of Fasting In Ramadan.</h2>
        
        
        <ul>
            <li style="color: cornflowerblue;"> Spiritual purification and self-discipline.</li>
            <p> Fasting is a means of spiritual purification, as it allows Muslims to purify their minds, hearts, and bodies through self-discipline, self-control, and introspection. By abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during the daylight hours, Muslims can develop greater self-awareness, humility, empathy, and a stronger connection with Allah.</p>
<li style="color: cornflowerblue;">Gratitude and empathy.</li>
<p> One of the benefits of fasting in Ramadan is that it’s an opportunity to express gratitude for the blessings of food, water, and physical health, which we often take for granted. Muslims are encouraged to give donations, pay Zakat, and perform good deeds during Ramadan, which alleviate the suffering of the marginalized community.</p>
        <li style="color: cornflowerblue;">Physical health and well-being.</li>
        <p> There are many physical and mental health benefits of fasting in Ramadan, such as managing our body weight, maintaining a balanced metabolism, and better controlling our blood sugar levels. By observing the fast during the day, the body gets a break from constant digestion, which can help improve metabolic function and promote overall health and well-being. </p>

<li style="color: cornflowerblue;">Better Blood Sugar Control.</li>
<p> Fasting can help control blood sugar levels by reducing insulin resistance and improving insulin sensitivity. When a person fasts, the body is forced to use stored glucose for energy, which helps reduce blood sugar levels. Fasting can also help reduce inflammation in the body, which is a contributing factor to insulin resistance. Additionally, fasting can help promote weight loss, which is important for controlling blood sugar levels, as excess body fat can lead to insulin resistance and high blood sugar levels</p>
<li style="color: cornflowerblue;">Boosted Immune System.</li>
<p> One of the important benefits of fasting in Ramadan is that it boosts the immune system. During a fast, the body shifts from using glucose as its primary source of energy to using ketones, which are produced from fat stores. This shift activates a process called autophagy, where the body starts to break down and recycle damaged cells, including those in the immune system. Autophagy helps to improve the function of the immune system, by removing old or damaged immune cells and replacing them with new, healthy ones. </p>
<li style="color: cornflowerblue;">Improved Sleep.</li>
<p> Fasting has been suggested to help improve sleep in several ways. For instance, fasting has been shown to reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can interfere with sleep. Additionally, among the benefits of fasting in Ramadan is that it has been linked to an increase in the production of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin. It  may also help regulate circadian rhythms, which are the natural 24-hour cycles that regulate many physiological processes in the body, including sleep. By aligning the body’s natural rhythms with the sleep-wake cycle, fasting may help improve the quality and duration of sleep.</p>
<li style="color: cornflowerblue;"> blood pressure </li>
<p> Fasting has been found to improve insulin sensitivity, which is also associated with lower blood pressure.</p>
             </ul>
