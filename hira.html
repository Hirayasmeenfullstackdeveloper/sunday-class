    <h1 style=" background-color:green;color:white">Pakistan Zindabad</h1>
       <p><span style="color: green
       ; font-weight: bold;"> Pakistan,[e] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</span>,[f] is a country in South Asia. It is the fifth-most populous country, with a population of over 241.5 million, having the second-largest Muslim population as of 2023.[8] Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre. Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by area, being the second-largest in South Asia. </p>
    <h2 style="background-color: green;color:white">Province Of Pakistan</h2>  
     There are 4 provinces of Pakistan
    <h2 style="background-color: green;color:white">Punjab</h2>  
   <p> <span style="color: green
    ; font-weight: bold;">Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers,</span> which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to 3000 BCE,[3] and had numerous migrations by the Indo-Aryan peoples. Agriculture has been the major economic feature of the Punjab and has therefore formed the foundation of Punjabi culture, with one's social status being determined by land ownership.</p>
    <h2 style="background-color: green;color:white">Balochistan</h2> 
   <p><span style="color: green
    ; font-weight: bold;"> The Balochistan region is split among three countries:</span> Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Administratively it comprises the Pakistani province of Balochistan, the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchestan, and the southern areas of Afghanistan, which include Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces.[8][9] It borders the Khyber Paktunkhwa region to the north, Sindh and Punjab to the east, and Iranian regions to the west. Its southern coastline, including the Makran Coast, is washed by the Arabian Sea, in particular by its western part, the Gulf of Oman. </p>
    <h2 style="background-color: green;color:white">Khaber Pakhtun Khaw</h2> 
   <p> <span style="color: green
    ; font-weight: bold;">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  Pashto:  Hindko,  formerly known as North West Frontier Province</span>, is a province of Pakistan. Located in the northwestern region of the country, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the fourth largest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by population. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the south, Punjab to the south-east, the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan to the north and north-east, Islamabad Capital Territory to the east and Azad Kashmir to the north-east. It shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has a varied landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges, valleys, plains surrounded by hills, undulating submontane areas and dense agricultural farms.</p>


    <h2 style="background-color: green;color:white">Sindh</h2>  
    <p><span style="color: green
        ; font-weight: bold;">Sindh is sometimes referred to as the Bab-ul Islam (transl. 'Gateway of Islam'),</span> as it was one of the first regions of the Indian subcontinent to fall under Islamic rule.[10][11] Ethnic Sindhi people constitute the largest group in the province; Sindh is also the place of residence for the overwhelming majority of Muhajirs (lit. 'migrants'), a multiethnic group of Indian Muslims who migrated to the region after the Partition of British India in 1947. The province is well known for its distinct culture, which is strongly influenced by Sufist Islam, an important marker of Sindhi identity for both Hindus and Muslims.[12] Sindh is prominent for its history during the Bronze Age under the Indus Valley civilization, and is home to two UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites: the Makli Necropolis and Mohenjo-daro</p>
